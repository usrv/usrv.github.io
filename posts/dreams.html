            <p>This is my first post!</p>
            <p>On this page, I will probably rant about my dreams (the sleep kind, though I have many many dreams for my future too). I have very interesting dreams that play like action movies. It's quite interesting, as my dreams feel very realistic to my subconscious mind, even though it could never happen in real life. Realistic dreaming provides me with the perfect balance of reality and fantasy in life :)</p>
