            <p>Interestingly enough, many of the books we consider great classics today were originally published as philosophical works from the Age of Reason. At a time when radical views and nonconformity were considered blasphemy, persecuted philosophers disguised their beliefs as works of fiction, expertly weaving their ideals into popular books of the day. One of the more famous of these stories was Gulliverâ€™s Travels, in which Jonathan Swift satirizes political workings through savage characters. The censorship of enlightenment ideas, though harsh and unjust, had one positive effect: without them, brilliant political fiction from eighteenth century England would not exist, replaced instead by legal documents and newspaper articles that would be much less entertaining to read.</p>
